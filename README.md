# Multi-feature-classification-and-description-text-generation

### introduction
The project is my graduation project. I designed a relatively complete model framework for multi-features classification on pathological slide image of liver cancer.

The main classification model is a CNN based FPN, feature fusion and channel attention mechanism, which has better preformance than traditional CNN classification, such as ResNet and DenseNet.

### start
I won't provide the slide images data because of several reasons. However, you can start train your data with my code. Pathological slide images, annotations of tumor regions and labels of features(Nuclear hyperchromatism, nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, envelope, growth morphology, etc.)
